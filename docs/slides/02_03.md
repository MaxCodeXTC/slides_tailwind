If you're familiar with CSS, most of the styles in Tailwinds are designed to mimic properties. Let's start looking at the styles available starting with Typography

<!-- .slide: data-state="layout-code-list" -->

# Line Height

- `leading-TYP`
  - **TYP** (line-height...in rem)<br>
  `3` .75 `4` 1 `5` 1.25 `6` 1.5<br>`7` 1.75 `8` 2 `9` 2.25 `10` 2.5
  - **TYP** (line-height...relative)<br>
  `none`  1 `tight` 1.25 `snug`  1.375<br>`normal`  1.5 `relaxed` 1.625 `loose` 2

With leading, you have two options, you can specify one of eight sizes that are sized in rem, which is relative to the root font sizes. Usually 16px.

You can also size relative to the line height in the current font size.

Just like with the other items, you can customize in the config file with using `theme.extend.lineHeight`, overriding existing items or adding new ones. You can turn this feature off using corePlugins.lineHeight and set it to false.

# Letter Spacing

- `tracking-TYP`
  - **TYP** (letter-spacing...in ems)<br>
  `tighter` -.05 `tight` -.025 `normal` 0<br>`wide` .025 `wider` .05 `widest` -.1 

> >

Text sizing is handled through the text class and you add a size option here. The size is in rems so it's relative to the root size of the browser, which is usually 16 pixels. Each of these sizes also has a line-height in rems.
