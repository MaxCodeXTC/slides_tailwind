Here's our plan. We're going to delete a couple of documents we're not going to use.

We'll create a new document where we're going to add a new page that will show our cart when we're ready to check out.

Then we'll spend some time fixing our routes so they point to this page.

Finally, It's a good idea to scaffold, which means map out the structure of our app, so we'll make a plan to create all of the components we'll need for this project.
