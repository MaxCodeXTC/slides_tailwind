# Padding

- `p(-DIR)(-SIZ)`
  - **DIR**
  `px` `py` `t` `r` `b` `l`
  - **SIZ** (padding in rem)<br>
  `0` `0.5` `1` `1.5` `2` `2.5` `3` `3.5`<br>
  `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `10` `11` `12`<br>
  `14` `16` `20` `24` `28` `32` `36` `40` `44`<br>
  `48` `52` `56` `60` `64` `72` `80` `96` `px`

Padding sets up the spacing inside an element's border section. You can see that there are some really rich options for padding.

You can apply padding on four sides at once using just a p. You can change all vertical padding at once with py, horizontal padding with px or each one of the sides with one of the four letters t- for top r- for right b- for bottom and l- forleft.

There are also a ton of size classes here. There are some pretty small classes at the beginning and some large ones towards the end. All sizes are in REMs, or root ems, which is set to 16 pixels except for a special size for a single pixel on all sides.

If you take a look at the example I've set up, you can see that I've added padding only to one side here as well as one unit of padding o the left.

margin sets up the spacing outside an element's border section. Like with padding, there are a ton of numbers you can use. However margin lets you specify negative margins so there are even more options.

You can apply margin on four sides at once using just a p. You can change all vertical margins at once with py, horizontal margin with px or each one of the sides with one of the four letters t- for top r- for right b- for bottom and l- for left. I find it easy to remember by thinking of the word TROUBLE without the consonants

There are also a ton of size classes here. There are some pretty small classes at the beginning and some large ones towards the end. All sizes are in REMs, or root ems, which is set to 16 pixels except for a special size for a single pixel on all sides.

If you take a look at the example I've set up, you can see that I've added padding only to one side here as well as one unit of padding o the left.

The width is probably one of the richest classes in Tailwind with tons of options. You can see that we have the traditional sizes from 1 to 96, but we also have fractional widths.

There's a lot of other intersting parameters that you can use. So, for example `auto` will let the browser decide the width of the content, `px` will give us the usual 1 pixel width, `full` will give us a width of 100%, `screen` gives us 100% of the width of the viewport, which is normally the browser width.

Finally, we have a couple of interesting values here. `min` gives us the width of the smallest word in our content, while max gives us the size of the largest word.

In the example, you'll note that I left a few values out because they're difficult to visualize on the layout I've designed, but please play around with them.

Height is pretty similar to width with a lot of the same values, except that it doesn't have the min and max values because they don't make as much sense.

Height is relative so in the example, you'll note that I'm just giving you a simple layout so you can play around with it.

Notice that there is a container with a value of screen for the height. That makes the layout the size of the viewport. The height is usually relative to the size of a container and it won't show up, so without the container height, the other heights won't show up properly.

# Min Width

- `min-w-(SIZ)`
  - **SIZ** `0` `full` `min` `max`

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/min-width" target="_blank"><code class="code-exciting">Docs</code></a> <a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/xxEbWwP?editors=1000" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

The min width parameter lets you specify the minimum width an element should have. It has only four options.

`0` is meant to reset most elements, `full` is meant to make the minimum width the size of the container, `min` means that it will try to fit the smallest word possible and `max` will try to fit all of the words.

In our example, notice that we've set the width of this element to 10, and if we didn't have these minimum utilities it would end up making our box too small.

# Max Width

  - **SIZ** `0` `none` `xs` `sm` `md` `lg` `xl`<br>`2xl` `3xl` `4xl` `5xl` `6xl` `7xl`<br>`full` `min` `max` `prose`<br> `screen-sm` `screen-md` `screen-lg` <br>
  `screen-xl` `screen-2xl`

You'd think that the max-width parameters would be similar to the min-width paramaters, but there are lots more options here. In addition to the traditional sizes, you also have the option here of sizing to different viewport sizes.

There's one REAL interesting option here called prose. It tries to set the width of the container so that the text fits nicely. you have to see it to believe so head on over to our example.

# Min Height

- `min-h-(SIZ)`
  
  - **SIZ**

 `0` `full` `screen`

Let's talk about min height. There's only a few options here, you can set that to 0, which is a reset. `full` means that the height of the element will fill the container, finally screen will try to make it fit the height of the viewport; which is usually the height of the browser.

# Max Height

- `max-h-(SIZ)`
  - **SIZ** `0` `px` `full` `screen`<br>
`0.5` `1` `1.5` `2` `2.5` `3` `3.5` `4`<br>
`5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `10` `11` `12` `14` `16`<br>
`20` `24` `28` `32` `36` `40` `44` `48` `52`<br>
`56` `60` `64` `72` `80` `96`<br>

Max width gives you the options of sizes like 0, 1 pixel, and full...which tries to fit it in 100% of the container height and screen...which uses the viewport's height. Usually the browser or device window.

Then there are a number of hard sizes in REMs that you can use for your layout.

`max-height` is one of those parameters that doesn't make any sense unless you see it in context. So in our example, it's important that I'm using a maximum height value together with the overflow classes.

# Opacity

- `opacity-AMT`
  - **AMT** (opacity/100)<br>
  `0` `5` `10` `20` `25` `30` `40` `50`<br>`60` `70` `75` `80` `90` `95` `100`

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/opacity" target="_blank"><code class="code-exciting">Docs</code></a> <a href="https://codepen.io/planetoftheweb/pen/QWKNMVN" target="_blank"><code class="code-royal">Try it</code></a>

> >

You can apply opacity to any element or to individual items within an element, so for example some items like the background allow you to change the opacity of just the background, but not the rest of the items, that's pretty powerful, but there is an overall opacity value as well.
